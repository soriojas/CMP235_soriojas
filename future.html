    <h1>The future of MCC’s community</h1>

    <p>MCC, even though many have tried to bring it’s players together, is still a small community, and I intend to make it more active by assimilating with other communities of the same genre.</p>
    <p>To do this, I will learn more about the “roguelikes” genre and how they ended up creating one whole community so that I may gather other people of the “gacha” community and bring them together.</p>

    <h2>Roguelikes</h2>
    <p>“Roguelikes” are a genre of turn based DnD-like games for computers. Their game mechanics resemble that of the Dungeons and Dragons board game. There are many different kinds of rogue likes with small communities.</p>

    <h2>Areas of research</h2>
    <h1>I am currently learning more about owners of the “roguelikes” subreddit, how the community was like in the early days, and how they have expanded their community. I am also learning how the roguelikes community in Discord started as well.</h1>
