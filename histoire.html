    <h1>My history with MCC</h1>
    <h2>Mobile games before Android</h2>
    <p>Before Android, I had a flip phone which didn’t have any games downloaded on it. 
    It was an LG Rumor Touch. There were games available for it but none of them were free. 
    It wasn’t until I discovered Cellufun that I started playing games on the phone for my first time.</p>
    <p>Cellufun is a website for mobile browsers with games that only used HTML, and possibly PHP. 
    Some of these were like idle games. The most notable one being their own version of Farmville. 
    The way it worked is that it showed the player a picture their farm, but it was really 4 different 
    clickable pictures put together to make up a whole picture. They were individually clickable because 
    they each led to different part of the game. For example, if I clicked the farm, it would take me to 
    a picture of a plot of soil, and if I clicked a link that said “plant corn” then it would take me to 
    another page with a picture of a farm plot with soil planted on top of it. All of the games Cellufun offered were free.</p>

    <h2>My first Android, and discovery of MCC</h2>
    <p>When I got my first Android, I was still playing on Cellufuns site through Android’s browser. 
    Like all sites who provide services for free, Cellufun always had ads on top of their site that were impossible 
    to <em>not </em>see. One ad that caught my attention was about MCC. I don’t usually click ads, but this one was 
    very convincing and I decided that I liked MCC.</p>
    
    <h2>Lack of communities based on Android gaming back then.</h2>
    <p>Cellufun had it’s own messaging system which kept it’s users very active with each other. MCC had one too, 
    but it was unsophisticated and restrictive for several reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You could only communicate with players in your friends list.</li>
        <li>You can only write 100 characters per message.</li>
        <li>You can only send 1 message every 10 minutes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This made MCC’s community less active than Cellufun, so people built communities in 3<sup>rd</sup> party apps or websites based on MCC, 
    without any restrictions on communication. Those communities were not very active as well, because at the time it was pretty uncommon to find 
    communities that were centered around a specific Android game.</p>

    <h2>No communication</h2>
    <p>When I started, there was actually no way to communicate with other players. The
    only form of text that you could write for other players to see was a status message,
    which appeared on your profile. Some people try to use this to share links to their
    social media profile, but this was difficult due to the game's filtration some some links.
    Nevertheless, people have found a way to avoid these filters and share the social media
    page.</p>
