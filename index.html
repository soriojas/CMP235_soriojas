    <h2 id="what_is">What is MCC?</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        MCC is a �Gacha� game created by Ambition and released for iOS and Android in 2013. �Gacha�
        is a genre of Japanese mobile games based on luck where players have a chance to roll in-game items of some value.
    </p>

    <h3>Development of other games of the same genre.</h3>
    <p>Ambition also created other games that used the same concept as MCC such as DG.</p>
    <p>
        DG was the first mobile app that I�ve ever known to use L2D graphics,
        and it wasn�t until later on that other game developers started using L2D
    </p>

    <h3>Competing titles of the same genre.</h3>
    <p>Brave Frontier was also a Gacha game made in 2013, but with a different concept. Brave Frontier also has RPG elements in it.</p>
