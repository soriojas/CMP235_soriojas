        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            MCC is a Gacha game created by Ambition and released for iOS and Android in 2013. Gacha
            is a genre of Japanese mobile games based on luck where players have a chance to roll in-game items of some value.
        </p>

        <h3>Development of other games of the same genre.</h3>
        <p>Ambition also created other games that used the same concept as MCC such as DG.</p>
        <p>
            DG was the first mobile app that Ive ever known to use L2D graphics,
            and it wasnt until later on that other game developers started using L2D
        </p>

        <h3>Competing titles of the same genre.</h3>
        <p>Brave Frontier was also a Gacha game made in 2013, but with a different concept. Brave Frontier also has RPG elements in it.</p>
