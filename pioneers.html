    <h1>Pioneers of MCC and its communities.</h1>

    <h2>Myself:</h2>
    <p>I was originally the pioneer of an MCC related community on reddit. The community I have created is three years old. I am also the pioneer of an MCC community on Discord.</p>

    <h3>Reddit:</h3>
    <p>Reddit is a forum where you can create new forums based on a specific subject for its community members to participate. These sub-forums were called “subreddits.”</p>
    <p>At that time, the MCC subreddit was owned by a different user, and the subreddit was not very active.</p>
    <p>In order be in control of the MCC subreddit, I needed to have something to contribute to it. So I decided to learn a little about CSS, and redesign the sub.</p>
    <p>Reddit allows users to change how their subreddit appears to other users by uploading a CSS file. I learned more about CSS by modifying existing CSS files and observing what happens when certain values get changed.</p>
    <p>After a little bit of experimenting with CSS, I came up with a design for the MCC subreddit and submitted it to the subreddit’s owner.</p>
    <p>Screenshot of the site’s design</p>
    <p>He appreciated the design and put me in charge of designing the subreddit and moderation, which put me in more than enough control to get the community going.</p>

    <h3>Discord:</h3>
    <p>Discord is a real-time communications software targeted toward people who play video games. Users of Discord can create servers based on games they may like and have other users participate in them.</p>
    <p>Discord, when it was first released, became popular very fast. It became more popular than Skype and TeamSpeak.</p>
    <p>Since Discord was trending, I decided to transition MCC’s community from Reddit to Discord because it was more convenient to use as a communication tool, and popular enough that more users were likely to use it. I have operated this community in Discord for about 2 years now.</p>

    <h2>Eric</h2>
    <p>Eric was the pioneer of his own MCC community on Twitter, and what inspired me to create a community in the first place.</p>
    <p>Eric was probably one of the earliest Twitter users who played MCC. There were few other users as well, but not as many as there are now. Eric was more active at the time and his activity may have influenced other players to create Twitter accounts to become a part of the community.</p>
    <p>Now he is inactive, but other Twitter accounts based on MCC are still active because of him.</p>

    <h2>Doud</h2>
    <p>Doud is the pioneer of MCC Wikia.</p>
    <p>Wikia is like encyclopedia made specifically for one subject. Doud made it about MCC.</p>
    <p>Doud was probably one of the earliest pioneers I’ve ever seen. He was always the top player in MCC’s leaderboard so that’s probably how he was able to build up his wikia community so quickly.</p>
    <p>The wikia is full of information and is voluntarily maintained by many MCC players.</p>
